## About the app
> This project is a binary medical image classification model, based on convolutional neural network architecture.
The CNN has trained on the following malaria parasite image dataset  <a href="https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/">National Library of Medicine</a>.
The trained model achieved accuracy of more than 95% on the test set and its weights have been saved in the Models folder (see file: my_model.h5). 





### Use other pre-trained model

See [Keras applications](https://keras.io/applications/) for more available models such as DenseNet, MobilNet, NASNet, etc.


## Deployment
To deploy in cloud, we can upload this app on heroku or other python enabled server.
